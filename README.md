# Autoclicker
## TL;DR
A small utility that generates mouse and keyboard input. 
## Features
- Automatically generate mouse *and* keyboard input.
- Set desired rate/frequency of clicks.
- Customizable keybinds, in order to make toggling easier.
- Well... yeah, it's just a fucking autoclicker wtf do you want? ðŸ˜† 
## Purpose
A friend of mine was looking for an autoclicker so that he could automate a tedious task in a game. I had used autoclickers before so I could have just recommended one of them but then I said "Fuck it! I will make my own!". And so I decided to learn how to use ImGui (awesome library btw!ðŸ˜Š) as well as the Win32 API (not as great...ðŸ˜¢) in order to make one.

Basically, the only real use case of this thing is to cheat in online games. It works great on Minecraft 1.8.9 (and I got successfully banned from a PvP server ðŸ˜Ž). The good thing is that it only has a couple of files that you can easily delete in case you find yourself in a screenshare session ðŸ˜³. I guess there could be more legitimate use cases of it, but frankly I don't really care. It's up to you, use your imagination ðŸŒˆ.
